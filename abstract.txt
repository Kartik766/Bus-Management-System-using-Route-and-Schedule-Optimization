Project Title: Bus Management System using  Route and Schedule Optimization

Domain / Technology: Web Application Development
Application: Public and private transportation companies,  intercity and intracity bus services
Dataset : Bus schedules, route details, passenger booking records, .
Expected  Processing:
Route and schedule optimization algorithms
Reporting and analytics for operational data

Expected Output from Project:
The system is expected to optimize bus routes and schedules by deploying more buses on high-demand routes and adjusting timings based on passenger load. It will provide accurate fare calculation, along with search and filter options for available buses to assist administrators

Abstract:
The Bus Route and Schedule Optimization System is designed to make public transportation more reliable, fair, and accessible for all passengers. The system continuously analyzes ticket sales to identify high-demand routes and ensures that additional buses are deployed where needed, reducing overcrowding and respecting the right of every passenger to safe and comfortable travel.
For administrators, it provides transparent tools such as fare calculation, search, and filtering of available buses, enabling fair pricing, efficient scheduling, and better decision-making. By combining demand-driven scheduling with equitable resource allocation, the system upholds passenger rights, ensures timely service, and promotes equal access to affordable transportation.
